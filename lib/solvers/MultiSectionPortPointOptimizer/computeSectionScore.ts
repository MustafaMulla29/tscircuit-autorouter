/**
 * Computes a log-based score for a section of nodes with port points.

 * The score is logSuccess = sum(log(1 - Pf)) for all contributing nodes.
 * This represents the log probability of all nodes succeeding.
 * Higher scores are better (closer to 0 means higher probability of success).
 *
 * Note: We return logSuccess directly instead of computing log(1 - exp(logSuccess)) to avoid
 * numerical precision issues when logSuccess is very negative (where exp(logSuccess) underflows to 0).
 *
 * @param nodesWithPortPoints - Nodes in the section with their assigned port points
 * @param capacityMeshNodeMap - Map from node ID to capacity mesh node for Pf calculation
 * @returns Score where higher is better (0 = perfect, more negative = more failures expected)
